# Implementation of a simple Logo language using html, css and javascript.

This is a collaborative project to develop a simple LOGO programming language designed to help students learn the basic concepts of programming logic. A set of commands can be entered to move a robot across the screen and create drawings. The commands are written in Spanish to make it easy to understand for Spanish-speaking students that don't know English yet.

## Available Commands
- **adelante**: Moves the robot forward.
- **atras**: Moves the robot backward.
- **derecha**: Rotates the robot towards the right.
- **izquierda**: Rotates the robot towards the left.
- **limpiar**: Clear the canvas screen.
- **centrar**: Centers the robot in the center of the screen.
- **repetir**: Repeats a set of commands the ammount of times specified.
- **levantar_pluma**: Picks the pen to begin drawing.
- **bajar_pluma**: Stops painting.
- **color**: Change the color of the pen.

## Syntax

```
